    Hello, I am a student of California State University Fullerton,
    as a Computer Science major and an aspiring coder with basic knowlege in C++

##  Three Favorite CPSC-120 Labs


1. The first lab that was my favorite was lab seven part one. I was absent for this lab, but I ended up doing it regardless and had a lot of fun. What I found really fun about this lab was writing the if statements and trying to get the boolean statements to work. At this point of the semester it felt like all the coding we had learned came together to create one big project. With the
.at() member function, boolean statements, and input validation all being important and foundational parts of the program.
    1. For example:
```
bool CanParkOnDate(const std::string& day, int hour, int min) {
  if ((day == "mon") && (hour >= 6) && (hour < 16) && (min >= 30)) {
    return false;  // yandere dev type code
  }
  if ((day == "mon") && (hour > 6) && (hour < 16)) {
    return false;
  }
  if ((day == "tue") && (hour >= 6) && (hour < 16) && (min >= 30)) {
    return false;
  }
}
```


2. Another lab that stuck with me was lab 10 part 2 as there were two parts of code that I felt I finally understood after doing the lab. This specifically would be for each loop and nested if statements. After working on this lab I understood the mechanical difference between a for loop and a for each loop, and how nested statements can be combined within them. Also during this lab I learned how const auto& can be used in a for each statement to write code that automatically knows the data type of the variable. 


3. The second to final lab lab 11 specifically part 2 as that had to do a lot with manipulating classes. Which is the foundation for object oriented programming. While at the same time used foundational code that we understood well at this point, such as return statements, if statements, and function calls. This lab was also similar to a previous lab where we had to code the same game but with different statements. The introduction of classes in this lab made it slightly more complicated and built off of what was done in the previous one. From this I learned how to optimize code using object oriented programming.
